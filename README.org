* telegram-music-archive
This project is a telegram bot (using =aiogram=) that can search and download tracks, maintain and organise your music library. It uses yandex music api(?) to search track metadata and youtube data api to download audio.
** Installation and launching
First, clone the project and navigate to the project folder:
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/tkerm94/telegram-music-archive && cd telegram-music-archive

You will also need to get the youtube data api key and telegram bot token, and then export them to a working shell:
